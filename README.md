# React Shopping Cart with Docker and Kubernetes

This is a web-based **shopping cart** application built using **React** that demonstrates modern practices in **containerization** and **orchestration** using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**. The project is designed to be highly scalable, portable, and easy to deploy across different environments. It integrates with a backend API for managing shopping cart items and is ready to be deployed both locally and in a cloud environment.

## Project Overview

This project implements a **React-based Shopping Cart** application that lets users view their cart items, adjust quantities, and finalize purchases. It also incorporates **Docker** for containerization and **Kubernetes** for orchestrating the application in a scalable and robust way.

The **backend** of the application is designed to fetch cart item data, update item quantities, and handle purchases. The **frontend** is built with React, ensuring a responsive and interactive user interface.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Shopping Cart**:
  - Display cart items with product name, price, description, quantity, and total.
  - Add, remove, and update quantities of items in the cart.
  - Dynamically calculate item totals and display the overall total.
  - Responsive design using **Bootstrap** to support all screen sizes.
- **Cart Functionality**:

  - Update item quantities with "+" and "-" buttons.
  - Remove items from the cart.
  - Display total price and provide options to finalize the purchase or continue shopping.

- **Docker Containerization**:

  - The frontend is containerized using **Docker**, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.

- **Kubernetes Orchestration**:
  - The app is designed to scale and run in a **Kubernetes** cluster with ease, ensuring that the app is highly available and can handle high traffic.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:

  - **React.js**: JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
  - **Bootstrap**: For responsive, mobile-first design.
  - **Font Awesome**: For icons used throughout the application.
  - **React Router DOM**: For navigation and routing in the app.

- **Backend**:

  - **Node.js** (optional for backend simulation): Can be integrated to handle cart operations, fetch items, and update quantities.

- **Containerization & Deployment**:

  - **Docker**: Used to create a containerized version of the React app.
  - **Kubernetes**: For managing the deployment, scaling, and operation of the containerized application in production.

- **Other Tools**:
  - **NPM**: For managing project dependencies and building the app.
  - **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
