# React Shopping Cart with Docker and Kubernetes

This is a web-based **shopping cart** application built using **React** that demonstrates modern practices in **containerization** and **orchestration** using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**. The project is designed to be highly scalable, portable, and easy to deploy across different environments. It integrates with a backend API for managing shopping cart items and is ready to be deployed both locally and in a cloud environment.

## Project Overview

This project implements a **React-based Shopping Cart** application that lets users view their cart items, adjust quantities, and finalize purchases. It also incorporates **Docker** for containerization and **Kubernetes** for orchestrating the application in a scalable and robust way.

The **backend** of the application is designed to fetch cart item data, update item quantities, and handle purchases. The **frontend** is built with React, ensuring a responsive and interactive user interface.

## Features

- **Interactive Shopping Cart**:
  - Display cart items with product name, price, description, quantity, and total.
  - Add, remove, and update quantities of items in the cart.
  - Dynamically calculate item totals and display the overall total.
  - Responsive design using **Bootstrap** to support all screen sizes.
- **Cart Functionality**:

  - Update item quantities with "+" and "-" buttons.
  - Remove items from the cart.
  - Display total price and provide options to finalize the purchase or continue shopping.

- **Docker Containerization**:

  - The frontend is containerized using **Docker**, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.

- **Kubernetes Orchestration**:
  - The app is designed to scale and run in a **Kubernetes** cluster with ease, ensuring that the app is highly available and can handle high traffic.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:

  - **React.js**: JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
  - **Bootstrap**: For responsive, mobile-first design.
  - **Font Awesome**: For icons used throughout the application.
  - **React Router DOM**: For navigation and routing in the app.

- **Backend**:

  - **Node.js** (optional for backend simulation): Can be integrated to handle cart operations, fetch items, and update quantities.

- **Containerization & Deployment**:

  - **Docker**: Used to create a containerized version of the React app.
  - **Kubernetes**: For managing the deployment, scaling, and operation of the containerized application in production.

- **Other Tools**:
  - **NPM**: For managing project dependencies and building the app.
  - **Git**: For version control and collaboration.
